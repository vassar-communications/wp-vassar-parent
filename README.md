# wp-vassar-parent

This is a parent theme for Vassar WordPress sites. 

* For development info, check the [project wiki](https://github.com/vassar-communications/wp-vassar-parent/wiki).
* If you're working on a child theme, and you're trying to configure some aspect of it, check the [config variables for the Vassar Child Theme](https://github.com/vassar-communications/wp-vassar-child/wiki/Config-variables). (You'd configure these on a site-by-site basis, which is why you'd define them in the setup file for your child theme, but they are built into the parent theme.)
